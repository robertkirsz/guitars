# Guitars

An app I coded in 2013 as my IT engineer's degree project.

It works okay in Chrome on desktop, so don't try to launch it in any other browser or on mobile device, okay?

[Click here](https://robertkirsz-guitars.netlify.app/) to check it out.

`npm install` - installs Gulp and http-server

`npm run watch` - watches for changes in SASS file and compiles it to CSS

`npm run serve` - launches HTTP server
